Team Ranker Prolog
This project implements a team ranking system based on game results using Prolog. It tracks game results, calculates team rankings, performance scores, and predicts match outcomes using different metrics, such as goals scored, goals conceded, and performance score.

Features
Team Rankings by Points: Rank teams based on their total points.
Team Rankings by Performance: Rank teams based on their overall performance score.
Match Prediction: Predicts match outcomes between teams based on performance scores.
Winnings Odds Calculation: Computes odds based on team performance.
Goal Differential Estimation: Estimate the difference in goals scored in a match.
Series Generation: Generates possible game outcomes (win/loss) for teams to reach a series of 3-5 games.
